AirBnB clone project!
Description
The AirBnb_clone Project is the part number 1 of a series of projecs we will do in our process to become Full-Stack Software Engineers. This first phase consists in a custom command-line interface that allow us to create, update an delete instances of different classes. Also, AirBnB project has a storage class and a BaseModel class that allows the console do its work.

Usage
The console works in interactive an non-interactive mode, like unix shell. It prints the prompt (hbnb) and waits and instruction:

Command	Example
Run the console	./console.py
Quit the console	(hbnb) quit
Display the help	(hbnb) help
Create an object	(hbnb) create
Show an object	(hbnb) show or (hbnb) .show()
Destroy an object	(hbnb) destroy or (hbnb) .destroy()
Show all objects	(hbnb) all or (hbnb) all
Update an object	(hbnb) update ""
Non-interactive mode example
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
Interactive mode example
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit

File Storage
The folder engine manages the serialization adn deserialization of all data. The class is defined in file_storage.py with methods to follow this: -> to_dict() -> -> JSON dump -> -> FILE -> -> JSON load -> ->

The init.py file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called storage, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance. This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.

Tests
All the code is tested with the unittest module.
